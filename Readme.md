**What is the Backup Plugin?**

The Backup plugin will literally backup your Indigo directory (/Library/Application Support/Indigo 5), and store it in a time/date stamped zip file, that is stored in ~/Documents/Indigo Backup. 

You can configure the plugin to use a schedule to backup (eg Every 2, 3, week, etc) or Choose "Perform a Manual Backup" from the Plugin Menu.

Alternatively you can use a Trigger Action to cause a backup to occur.  

**Installation**

Double click on the plugin bundle, to have Indigo install the plugin.

If for some reason you need to manually re-install the plugin, you will need to open the Indigo Plugin Directory, and drag the new version into the folder.

Double clicking on the plugin will *not* overwrite the old plugin if it is the same version number.

**Support: **
For issues or questions, please contact Benjamin@schollnick.net.  

While I do have specific forums setup in the Indigo Forums, I am not as active as use to be with the Indigo Forums.  

The only reliable method of getting support is via Email.

**Donations: **

To help fund the continued development of this plugin...  Please consider donating. 

At this time my software is free, including the Indigo Web Plugin’s and attachment scripts…

But the cost to make the plugins and other software is not cheap.  Not to mention the additional cost of
keeping current in the Home Automation field, and research, etc…

Some of the users of my software has asked about making Donations…  So, here’s the plan:

If you want your donation to be payment for a software package, please write it down in the donation’s comments.  Otherwise the donation will go towards paying for Web Hosting.  Anyone that indicates that they wish to be credited for a donation, will be listed as a donor, either on the website and/or software plugin (if the user was donating to a specific plugin).

To Donate, please go to http://www.schollnick.net/wordpress/about/donations/   and click on the
donate icon.

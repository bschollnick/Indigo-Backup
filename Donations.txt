Donations:

To help fund the continued development of this plugin...  Please consider donating. 

At this time my software is free, including the Indigo Web Plugin’s and attachment scripts…

But the cost to make the plugins and other software is not cheap.  Not to mention the additional cost of
keeping current in the Home Automation field, and research, etc…

Some of the users of my software has asked about making Donations…  So, here’s the plan:

If you want your donation to be payment for a software package, please write it down in the donation’s 
comments.  Otherwise the donation will go towards paying for Web Hosting.  Anyone that indicates that
they wish to be credited for a donation, will be listed as a donor, either on the website and/or 
software plugin (if the user was donating to a specific plugin).

To Donate, please go to http://www.schollnick.net/wordpress/about/donations/   and click on the
donate icon.
